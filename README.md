# How To Get Up And Running

This repo uses python 3.10

All packages installed are included in requirements.txt

There is a sqlite3.db file, in case you would like some dummy data.

The front end client is in [this repo](https://github.com/DewofyourYouth/forum-client)

## TODO

* Update and delete on the front end
* Refresh the UI when a Thread or Comment is added (probably by using the store middleware for the API - or using something like react query)
